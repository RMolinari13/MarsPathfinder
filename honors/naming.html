			<h3 class="article-text">Naming</h3>

			<p class="article-text">The name Sojourner was chosen for the Mars Pathfinder rover after a year-long, worldwide competition in which students up to 18 years old were invited to select a heroine and submit an essay about her historical accomplishments. The students were asked to address in their essays how a planetary rover named for their heroine would translate these accomplishments to the Martian environment.</p>

			<p class="article-text">Initiated in March 1994 by The Planetary Society of Pasadena, California, in cooperation with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), the contest got under way with an announcement in the January 1995 issue of the National Science Teachers Association's magazine Science and Children, circulated to 20,000 teachers and schools across the nation.</p>

			<p class="article-text">The winning essay, which suggested naming the rover for Sojourner Truth, was selected from among 3,500 essays and was submitted by 12-year-old Valerie Ambroise of Bridgeport, CT. First runner-up was Deepti Rohatgi, 18, of Rockville, MD, who suggested Marie Curie. Second runner-up was Adam Sheedy, 15, of Round Rock, TX, who submitted the name of the late astronaut Judith Resnik, who perished in the 1986 Challenger space shuttle explosion. Other popular suggestions included Sacajewea and Amelia Earhart.</p>
